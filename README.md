# Cpp-Showcase
Projects that I have been completed in C/Cpp language

Ranging from inheritance, to overloading functions and operators, to creating a database that reads in excel files and creates a new file with updates based on a query, 
these projects demonstrate my ability to code efficently and along side a team to create well-structured programs.

I have been coding in C++ since 2017 and have continued to adapt and learn new strategies and ideas to implement in my code.
C language has been a new area of learning, but has been implemented into my projects more as my undergrad studies continue.
